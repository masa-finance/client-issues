# Masa Client Issues Repository

## Overview

This repository serves as a centralized system for tracking and triaging client issues across all Masa products (Subnet + Protocol).

## Purpose

The primary goals of this repository are to:

1. Centralize issue tracking for all Masa products
2. Streamline the triage process
3. Improve communication and transparency with clients
4. Facilitate better collaboration among team members

## How to Use This Repository

### Reporting an Issue

To report a new issue:

1. Go to the "Issues" tab
2. Click on "New Issue"
3. Choose the appropriate template:
   - Bug Report
   - Feature Request
   - General Inquiry
4. Fill out the template with as much detail as possible
5. Submit the issue

### Triaging Issues

Team members responsible for triage should:

1. Review new issues daily
2. Assign appropriate labels (product, priority, status)
3. Assign the issue to the relevant team or individual
4. Update the issue status as it progresses
5. Add the issue to the project board in the appropriate column

### Issue Lifecycle

1. New issues start in the "To Do" column of the project board
2. When work begins, move the issue to "In Progress"
3. Once ready for review, move to "In Review"
4. After final approval, move to "Done"
5. Issues that are not immediately actionable are moved to "No Status"

## Labels

We use the following label categories:

- Product: `product:subnet`, `product:protocol`
- Priority: `priority:high`, `priority:medium`, `priority:low`
- Status: `status:triage`, `status:in-progress`, `status:resolved`

## Templates

We have three issue templates:

1. Bug Report: For reporting problems or unexpected behavior
2. Feature Request: For suggesting new features or improvements
3. General Inquiry: For asking questions about Masa products

## Project Board

We use a GitHub project board to visualize our workflow and track the progress of issues. The board consists of the following columns:

1. **Ready**: Newly triaged issues that are ready to be worked on
2. **In Progress**: Issues currently being addressed by the team
3. **In Review**: Issues that have been resolved and are awaiting final review
4. **Done**: Issues that have been completely resolved and closed
5. **No Status**: Issues that have not been triaged and are not immediately actionable

### Using the Project Board

- All new issues should be added to the "Ready" column after triage
- Team members should update the status of their assigned issues by moving them to the appropriate column
- Use the project board during stand-ups and team meetings to discuss progress and identify bottlenecks

## Team Responsibilities

- Project Manager: Oversees the overall issue management process and maintains the project board
- Triage Team: Reviews new issues, assigns labels, and adds them to the "Ready" column
- Development Team: Moves issues through "In Progress" and "In Review" columns as they work
- Quality Assurance: Reviews issues in the "In Review" column and either approves them for "Done" or moves them back to "In Progress"
- Client Communication Team: Updates clients on issue status based on the project board

## Best Practices

1. Always use the provided templates when creating new issues
2. Be descriptive and provide as much relevant information as possible
3. Keep issue discussions on-topic and professional
4. Update the issue status promptly by moving cards on the project board
5. Review the project board regularly to ensure it reflects the current state of work
6. Use the project board during team meetings to facilitate discussions
7. Regularly clean up the "Done" column by archiving completed issues
